###### Uttran Ishtalingam


## What is JMS
> JMS is a specification that provides a common way for Java programs to create, send, receive and read an enterprise messaging systemâ€™s messages


### What is Enterprise messaging
> Enterprise messaging is that messages are delivered **asynchronously** from one system to others over a network

Note:
sender is not required to wait for the message to be received
each message is self-contained and carries all of the data and state needed

Increase the clients dynamically
(A message is guaranteed to be delivered once and only once)
