## Gradle as DevOps Glue
#### Attaching Legacy Products to a Pipeline
Note:  This talk is about how we have been using Gradle to automate our Legacy On Premise products to achieve the
same benefits web deployed products can get from DevOps.


## Adam Roberts
#### Technical Lead @ [PROS, Inc.](http://pros.com)
Note: Proposal:
* Create a simple cost effective method of enforcing software license compliance.
* Convert our release process from a 3 week manual effort to a 12 hour no touch process.
* Automate the creation of reproducible environments for development and testing.
* Convert our many of our manual test cases into BDDs.

## Founded in 1985
Note:  For the people in the room that grew up with the internet a little history is in order.

The Internet became openly available between 1986 and 1991 per http://www.internetsociety.org/history?gclid=CNu-ieS0h80CFQEGaQodYesKyw

Amazon Web Services kicked off the modern cloud in 2006 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Origin_of_the_term

The term DevOps was coined in 2008


## Technology Evolves
* Switched from C++ to Java in 1999
* Dependency Resolution in 2008
* Nightly build to Continuous Integration in 2011
Note:  Even though PROS is old, the reason that the company is still around is that they have a long history of adapting to new technologies.


## Products
#### Historical & Current
* ~ 20 On Premise
* ~ 8 Software as Service
* ~ 4 DevOps from Day 1
Note:  PROS started investing into Cloud development relatively early, and has been using DevOps tools for years.
But that doesn't mean that all of the On Premise products go away they still have customers so the legacy products need to be maintained and in many cases new sales continue.  One thing to remember, in many cases a "Legacy Product" also means a "Profitable Product".


#### On Premise Challenge
## Automation
Note:  So the challenge is how can the developers on these Legacy products get the benefit of DevOps when their product was developed and sold before DevOps existed.
